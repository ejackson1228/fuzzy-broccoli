Description: 
    
    In this opportunity, the marketing agency "Horiseon" needed their website's codebase to follow accesibility standards so their site was optimized for search engines. This was made possible by:
        
        -adding semantic HTML elements
        -reorganizing the HTML structure to follow logical standards
        -adding alt attributes to the img sources
        -reorganizing the styling sheet to follow logical standards
        -putting the heading attributes in sequential order
        -adding a descriptive title to the title element

    The websites appearance has not changed. Prior to the aforementioned changes, the website had a couple broken code snippets. These broken snippets included:  
        
        -the inability to route the user to the Search Engine Optimization section when the anchor was clicked on.
            -solved by: defining a class in the search-engine-optimization div of the section
        -missing closing tags
            -solved by: adding closing tags

Side note: due to errors in setting up the initial repository and git access, a new repository was created after changes to the HTML and styling sheet had already been made. Therefore, there are multiple commits that will not show up in the correct repository.
